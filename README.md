# Jupyter Notebooks
Jupyter Notebooks are documents that contain both text and executable python code, so you can read about it and run examples.
Here is more information about them: https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html

Here I'm compiling the notebooks I've done while being a Suplemental Instructor for the
Introduction To Programming class in Santa Barbara City College, which is taught in Python. 

Examples are taken from books Python Crash Course, by Eric Matthes. and Python for Everyone, by C. Horstmann, 2ndEdition.

To run the notebooks: 
 1. You can download the Anaconda Navigator, which contains the Jupyter Notebook app that will allow you to run the downloaded
 notebooks. 
 
 2. Or you can follow the urls that I've made and shared!
